# 4 Project Definition

## 4.1 Mission and Spacecraft Performance
This project shall be a Category 3 per NPR 7120.5E, and the mission shall be D per NPR 8705.4.

The HERMES mission shall be designed to operate for a baseline of 24 months after on-orbit checkout once Gateway is in its lunar orbit. The threshold operations lifetime shall be for a period of 6 (six) months after on-orbit checkout. The Gateway will provide the HERMES payload with sufficient power, uplink and downlink telemetry, and attitude knowledge to accomplish the measurements described in Section 4.1.

## 4.2 Launch Requirements
Launch will take place from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) aboard the SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. Launch services will be provided by the Gateway Program Office. HERMES will be a hosted payload attached directly to the HALO module prior to launch. HERMES is being formulated and implemented to meet the launch window and orbit defined by the Gateway Program.

## 4.3 HERMES Ground System Requirements
The HERMES Mission Operations Center (MOC) will be developed under the HERMES Project Office at Goddard. The Space Weather Science Operations Center (SOC) is being developed in parallel with the MOC, but separate from the HERMES project. The Mission Operations Manager and SOC Manager, respectively, are responsible for day-to-day activities related to their development. The MOC enables two-way communications with the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), providing operational control for the HERMES science mission. HERMES table loads and real-time commands are issued directly from the MOC to the HOSC for uplink. The MOC processes downlinked science telemetry received from the HOSC into Level 0 datasets, which are then transferred to the science data processing element in the SOC and used to create higher-level products. High-level data products produced by the HERMES instrument science teams are transferred with a specified cadence to a permanent science data archive at NASA’s Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF), located at Goddard.

During Phase E, management of science activities and payload operations will transition to become the responsibility of the HERMES Project Scientist. The Project Scientist will coordinate with the HERMES instrument science teams to ensure the successful operation of the HERMES payload on-board the Gateway. The Project Scientist will also ensure that funding is
provided, and related enabling activities are conducted in a manner that allows the continued functioning of the HERMES payload operations facilities throughout the Baseline and Extended Missions and into Phase F.

## 4.4 Mission Data Requirements

### 4.4.1 Science Data Management

The HERMES project shall develop a Project Data Management Plan (PDMP) consistent with SMD policy for processing, distribution, and archiving of HERMES data.

The HERMES Project Scientist and the HERMES instrument Principal Investigators shall be responsible for initial analysis of the data, its subsequent delivery to an appropriate data repository, the publication of scientific findings, and communication of results to the public.  Additionally, the HERMES team shall be responsible for collecting engineering and ancillary information necessary to validate and calibrate the scientific data prior to depositing it in a NASA-approved data repository. The time required to complete this process shall be the minimum necessary to provide accurate and complete scientific data to the science community and the general public. The HERMES project science database shall be made available to the science community without restrictions or proprietary data rights of any kind. The data from the ground station(s) will be routed to the MOC at Goddard for processing, distribution, and data storage/archiving. Science and instrument data, along with processed health and safety data, will be transmitted to the Space Weather SOC. The SOC will perform instrument data processing and enable scientific analysis of instrument data.

### 4.4.2 Data Management Plan

The HERMES project shall develop a project data management plan to address the total activity associated with the flow of science data, from acquisition, through processing, data product generation and validation, to archiving and preservation. The data management plan shall be generated in preliminary form by the project Single Design Review and formally approved as a Level 2 requirement no later than the project's Pre-Ship Review. Science analysis software development, utilization, and ownership shall be covered in the Data Management Plan. Mission Success Criteria

### 4.5.1 Baseline Mission

For the Baseline HERMES Mission, the project shall be considered successful if HERMES achieves lunar orbit, completes commissioning, produces at least 415 gigabytes (GB) of Level-1 science data, and submits all Level-1 and associated Level-2 data to a public archive for use by the scientific community. This Level-1 data volume is 75% of that which can be acquired during 6 months of continuous operation of HERMES.

### 4.5.2 Threshold Mission

For the Threshold HERMES Mission (EEA descope as in 3.1.2 above, and reduced instrument resolutions as in Table 2), the project shall be considered successful if HERMES achieves lunar orbit, completes commissioning, produces at least 30 gigabytes (GB) of Level-1 science data, and submits all Level-1 and associated Level-2 data to a public mission archive for use by the scientific community. This Level-1 data volume is 75% of that which can be acquired during 6 months of continuous operation of a descoped HERMES.
