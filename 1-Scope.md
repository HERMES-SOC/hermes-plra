# 1 Scope

This appendix to the Living With a Star Program Plan identifies the Level 1 mission, science, and programmatic (funding and schedule) requirements imposed on Goddard Space Flight  Center (Goddard) for the development and operation of the Heliophysics Environmental and Radiation Monitoring Experiment Suite (HERMES) project as part of the Living With a Star Program. Requirements begin in Section 3. Sections 1, and 2 are intended to set the context for the requirements that follow. This document serves as the basis for mission assessments conducted by NASA Headquarters during the development period and provides the baseline for the determination of the science mission success following the completion of the operational phase.

Program authority is delegated from the Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate (AA/SMD) through the Heliophysics Division (HPD) to the Living With a Star Program Manager at Goddard. Project management will be conducted at Goddard (see Section 3.1).

Changes to information and requirements contained in this document require approval by the Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters by the same signatories that approved the original.
