# Programmatic Requirements

This section defines the requirements for all elements of the HERMES mission.
## 3.1 Science Requirements

### 3.1.1 Baseline Science Requirements

The HERMES payload will measure magnetic fields, electron and ion velocity distributions, and energetic particle intensities to determine properties of the thermal plasma environment and the charged-particle radiation environment in cis-lunar space. These observations will be made with sufficient cadence, sensitivity, and coverage of particle energies and directions to satisfy science objectives of the HERMES Project.

Instrument characteristics necessary to achieve the Baseline Science Requirements are specified in Table 1.

Table 1. Baseline Science Instrument Requirements

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Thermal Electrons (EEA)     | Electron Velocity Distribution                   | 5 eV to 10 keV in 32 steps, dE/E = 0.2                                                   | 360 deg parallel to base plate, +/- 22.5 deg resolution    | 1.0 s           |
| Thermal Ions (SPAN-i)       | Ion Velocity Distribution (mass/charge resolved) | 2 eV to 40 keV, 32 steps, dE/E = 0.16                                                    | 247.5 deg perp to base plate, +/- 45 deg out of plane      | 1.0 s           |
| Energetic Particles (MERiT) | Proton and Electron Flux                         | Protons: 1 to 190 MeV, 20 bins, dE/E = 0.3; Electrons: 0.3 to 9 MeV, 11 bins, dE/E = 0.3 | 120 deg copnical sunward and 120 deg conical anti-sunwward | 1.0 s           |

### 3.1.2 Threshold Science Requirements

The mass limit for the HERMES payload is 25 kg (TBR). If the payload cannot meet this requirement, then in the absence of an exception to the limit, it will be necessary to descope the instrument complement. Of the 4 instruments, removal of the EEA would have the least impact on the Baseline Science Objectives and Requirements. For threshold science, the time resolution for all instruments is reduced. For the energetic particles, the number of energy bins is reduced. The values specified in Table 2 are consistent with minimum requirements to accomplish the science objectives. Although more limited than the Baseline, the Threshold Mission will provide for substantial scientific return.

Instrument characteristics necessary to achieve the Threshold Science Requirements are specified in Table 2.
